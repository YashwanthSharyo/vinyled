        "Vaibhav and his team at Vinyled did a spectacular job on my GS 1300. The PPF was fitted so well that itâ€™s completely indistinguishable from the bike. I was thoroughly happy to see the bike once it was covered in PPF and have to say I couldnâ€™t have asked for more.\n\nAlso, these guys are thorough professionals. Vaibhav spent quite a bit of time explaining about the product and process and we had a good chat. The bike was done and delivered on time as promised.\n\nI would highly recommend them for anyone looking to get their vehicle PPF covered or wrapped.",

If you're looking to hand over your car to a true professional and no-nonsense place, this is the only place in Bangalore. After in-depth research and visiting various detailing studios, I can say these guys stand out. They donâ€™t falsely promote brands for profit margins â€” they provide genuine suggestions based on customer requirements. And for those looking for unique customizations, this team nails it with their one-of-a-kind designs. A huge shout-out to the entire Vinyled team â€” itâ€™s rare to find such professionalism.",

They suggested colors, showed me each item, and explained everything in detail. The outcome was absolutely amazing. You can blindly trust them, and I assure you they will do wonders to your vehicle.",

Mr. Vaibhav was excellent at accommodating my ideas and also suggested a few improvements. Thank you Vaibhav and team for executing the project flawlessly. The bike looks superb and is a showstopper on the roads. The pricing is also competitive and affordable considering the excellent craftsmanship. Iâ€™m going to get my car customised as well. I would definitely recommend people to check out their work.",

        "5/5 on quality of vinyl and wrap. 2/5 after they fit the parts. Thatâ€™s where the main issue happens. They will not bother to put the wires, frames properly, incorrect nuts and bolts here and there. This is a pain point for most of these kinds of services. Please keep a close watch when the work is done. I had constantly monitored, even then they made mistakes while fixing back parts, wiring, and panels. When you pay a premium price over other cheap services, you would not like to compromise on this. Otherwise, the vinyl work is top notch.",

Vaibhavâ€™s personal touch and commitment to excellence make this shop a standout in the industry. I highly recommend Vinyled for all your bike customization needs.`,

Post installation inspection and support, tips on care and maintenance were explained thoroughly. Team Vinyledâ€™s depth of knowledge and expertise is amazing. Worth every penny spent!",

        "I gotta say, my recent visit to Vinyled totally blew me away. I mean, talk about professionalism and customer care â€“ they nailed it, especially when it came to applying PPF. Right from the get-go, the team was super friendly and knew their stuff. They walked me through everything, making sure I was comfortable and sorting out any worries I had.\n\nBut here's the kicker â€“ Vaibhav, the boss man, he was something else. His attention to detail was next level. He really cared about making sure I was happy with the job. And when I hit a snag with the PPF a few days later, Vaibhav didn't bat an eye. He told me to swing by, and boom, problem solved. That's what I call dedication.\n\nHonestly, after that, I have total faith in Vinyled. They're not just about slapping on some film â€“ they genuinely care about making sure you're satisfied. So, if you're a Himalayan 450 owner like me, or just someone who wants top-notch PPF and killer service, Vinyled's where it's at ðŸ”¥",
